# Methodology and Workflow

## 1. Problem Statement
Brief description of why QoS classification in 5G networks is important.

## 2. Objectives
- Accurate classification of QoS flows  
- Support multiple ML/DL models  
- Deployable via FastAPI + Docker  

## 3. Workflow Overview
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing  
2. Feature Engineering (latency, jitter, packet loss, etc.)  
3. Model Training (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, LSTM, BiLSTM)  
4. Model Evaluation  
5. Deployment via FastAPI  

## 4. Workflow Diagram
( **data → preprocessing → model → API → evaluation**)
