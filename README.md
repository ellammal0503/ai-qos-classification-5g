## üìå Description  
This repository contains the implementation of **AI-based QoS Classification in 5G Networks**, developed as part of the **Samsung EnnovateX 2025 AI Challenge**.  

The project focuses on building a **multi-model machine learning platform** that can classify real-time 5G traffic into QoS classes (URLLC, eMBB, mMTC) using:  
- **Classical ML Models**: Random Forest, SVM, KNN  
- **Deep Learning Models**: LSTM, BiLSTM with Attention, IP Embedding  

The system is optimized for **low-latency prediction**, packaged with **FastAPI** for real-time inference, and containerized using **Docker** for cloud-native deployment.

**Problem Statement** - Problem Statement #8
Classify User Application Traffic at the Network in a Multi-UE Connected Scenario Applications are affected differently under varying traffic conditions, channel states, and coverage scenarios. If the traffic of each UE can be categorized into broader   categories, such as Video Streaming, Audio Calls, Video Calls, Gaming, Video Uploads, browsing, texting etc. that can enable the Network to serve a differentiated and curated QoS for each type of traffic. Develop an AI model to analyze a traffic pattern and predict the application category with high accuracy.
